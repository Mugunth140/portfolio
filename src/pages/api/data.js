Designed with scalability and ease of use in mind, MAuth allows developers to quickly add authentication features to their Node.js projects while ensuring secure handling of user credentials.Key Features:User Registration & Login: MAuth allows users to securely register and log in using their email and password. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage for added security.JWT Authentication: On successful login, MAuth generates a JWT token that can be used for authenticating API requests and protecting routes across the application.Route Protection Middleware: MAuth includes a middleware (AuthGuard) to protect sensitive routes. The middleware checks for the presence of a valid JWT token in the request headers, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.Modular & Flexible: MAuth is composed of easy-to-use modules such as AuthService, AuthProvider, and AuthGuard, each responsible for specific aspects of authentication, making the system highly modular and adaptable for various project structures.Error Handling: Clear error messages are provided for common authentication issues, such as invalid credentials or missing tokens, to help developers quickly debug and handle authentication errors."
